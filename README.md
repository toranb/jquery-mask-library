# jquery-mask-library #

A global jquery plugin that makes masking inputs simple

## Why does this exist? ##

The library has been deployed as part of the ember-cli ecosystem (look for the ember-cli-phone-number addon)

* Ember-Cli 0.1.4
* Ember-Cli 0.1.5

## Credits and collaboration ##

This plugin is now maintained by [Toran Billups](http://twitter.com/toranb)

## License ##

The license for the original jquery plugin is still in the file itself but because that version is no longer maintained I've created this simple fork
